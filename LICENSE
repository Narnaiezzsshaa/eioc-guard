ETHOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Design systems that protect dignity, restore signal, and quietly encode legacy."

This framework exists because vulnerable people deserve protection that 
doesn't require enterprise budgets. The humanitarian provisions above are 
not an afterthought—they are the point.

Commercial entities seeking to profit from this work are welcome to 
negotiate fair terms. Those seeking to extract without compensation 
should look elsewhere.
