# Generic vs. EIOC-Enhanced Scenarios

## The Difference at a Glance

Traditional security awareness training teaches people to spot obvious red flags.

EIOC Guard trains people to recognize **emotional manipulation from trusted sources**—the attacks that actually succeed.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Industry / Role | Generic Scenario | EIOC-Enhanced Scenario | Emotional Indicators Layered |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Healthcare – Nurse** | Email titled "Critical Patient Update" with malicious PDF | Email from trusted colleague referencing a patient you both discussed last week; tone stressed: *"I'm overwhelmed, please review urgently before my shift ends"* | Trust, continuity, empathy, duty, time pressure, guilt |
| **Utilities – Plant Operator** | USB labeled "Shift Schedule" found in break room | Exhausted colleague hands you a USB, apologizing: *"If you don't load this now, the next shift will be stranded"* | Trust, empathy, duty, urgency, guilt |
| **Finance – CFO** | Fake CEO email requesting urgent wire transfer | Email from CFO referencing yesterday's board meeting; tone anxious: *"I need this transfer approved before auditors arrive. I'm counting on you"* | Authority, continuity, empathy, duty, urgency, guilt |
| **Retail – Cashier** | Text claiming "POS system update" with link | Message from store manager referencing last outage; tone urgent: *"If you don't update now, we'll lose peak-hour sales"* | Authority, continuity, duty, urgency, guilt |
| **Education – Teacher** | Student email with malicious "project file" | Email from mentee referencing last feedback session; tone pleading: *"I'm desperate to get this right before tomorrow's deadline. Please check my file quickly"* | Trust, continuity, empathy, duty, urgency, guilt |
| **Manufacturing – Engineer** | Email with "updated design file" attachment | Email from project lead referencing last CAD review; tone urgent: *"If you don't check this update now, production will stall"* | Authority, continuity, duty, urgency, guilt |
| **Technology – Developer** | Email with link to "critical repo update" | Message from senior engineer referencing last sprint bug fix; tone urgent: *"If you don't pull this repo now, the release will fail"* | Trust, continuity, duty, urgency, guilt |
| **Insurance – Claims Adjuster** | Email with suspicious claim PDF | Email from colleague referencing last case handled; tone pleading: *"I'm drowning in cases. Can you review this claim immediately?"* | Trust, continuity, empathy, duty, urgency |

## Why This Matters

### Generic Training

- ❌ Tests whether you can spot a suspicious email
- ❌ Obvious red flags (bad grammar, unknown sender, strange links)
- ❌ Easy to pass without changing behavior
- ❌ Attackers have already adapted beyond this

### EIOC Training

- ✅ Tests whether you can spot manipulation from someone you trust
- ✅ Subtle emotional exploitation (guilt, empathy, duty, urgency)
- ✅ Builds genuine recognition skills
- ✅ Prepares for how real attacks actually work

## The Emotional Indicators

| Indicator | How Attackers Exploit It |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Trust** | Message comes from someone you know and have worked with |
| **Continuity** | References shared history, past interactions, real events |
| **Empathy** | Attacker appears stressed, overwhelmed, in distress |
| **Duty** | Appeals to professional responsibility and obligation |
| **Urgency** | Time pressure that bypasses normal verification |
| **Guilt** | "If you don't help, something bad happens to someone" |
| **Authority** | Comes from someone senior, respected, or in power |

Sophisticated attacks **layer multiple indicators**. The more layers, the harder to detect.

## The Gap in the Market

| Existing Players | EIOC Guard |
|------------------|------------|
| KnowBe4, Proofpoint, Mimecast | Soft Armor Labs |
| Focus: Recognize phishing emails | Focus: Recognize emotional manipulation |
| Approach: Fear/compliance-based | Approach: Stewardship/empowerment |
| Metric: Click rates | Metric: Emotional resilience |
| Content: Generic scenarios | Content: Role-specific vulnerability profiling |

## The Question EIOC Answers

**Generic training asks:**
> "Can you spot the phishing email?"

**EIOC Guard asks:**
> "Can you spot the manipulation from someone you trust, referencing shared history, when you feel guilty for not helping?"

That's a different skill. That's what sophisticated social engineering actually exploits. And that's what EIOC Guard trains people to recognize.
