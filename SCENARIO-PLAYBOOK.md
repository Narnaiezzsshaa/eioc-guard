# EIOC Guard™ Scenario Playbook

## Emotionally Layered Role-Specific Vulnerability Profiling

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This playbook expands EIOC Guard's assessment framework with **emotionally sophisticated scenarios** that go beyond generic phishing recognition. These scenarios simulate real-world social engineering attacks that exploit trust, empathy, guilt, and relational continuity—the psychological vulnerabilities that compliance training ignores.

---

## 🧭 What Makes EIOC Different

| Generic Security Awareness | EIOC Guard |
|---------------------------|------------|
| "Spot the suspicious email" | "Spot the manipulation from someone you trust" |
| Obvious red flags | Subtle emotional exploitation |
| Attack-vector focused | Relationship-exploitation focused |
| Tests technical awareness | Tests emotional resilience |
| Compliance checkbox | Genuine preparedness |

---

## 🔑 Emotional Indicators Taxonomy

Each scenario exploits one or more of these emotional vectors:

| Indicator | Exploitation Method |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Trust** | Comes from someone you know and have worked with |
| **Continuity** | References shared history, past interactions |
| **Empathy** | Attacker appears stressed, overwhelmed, vulnerable |
| **Duty** | Appeals to professional responsibility |
| **Urgency** | Time pressure that bypasses verification |
| **Guilt** | "If you don't help, something bad happens" |
| **Authority** | Comes from someone senior or respected |

Sophisticated attacks layer multiple indicators. The more layers, the harder to detect.

## 📊 Scenario Design Template

Use this template for creating new emotionally layered scenarios:

```
### [Role Title]

**Generic version:**
> [Standard security awareness scenario]

**EIOC-Enhanced:**
> [Scenario that includes:]
> - Trusted relationship (someone known)
> - Continuity reference (shared history)
> - Emotional tone (stress, apology, pleading)
> - Consequence framing (guilt trigger)
> - Time pressure (urgency)

**Emotional Indicators:** [List applicable indicators]

**Questionnaire Prompt:** *"[Question that surfaces the emotional manipulation, not just the technical red flag]"*
```

---

## 🔄 Facilitator Guidance

### Training Approach

1. **Start with the generic scenario** — Let participants identify obvious red flags
2. **Introduce the EIOC-enhanced version** — Watch how confidence drops
3. **Debrief the emotional layers** — Name each indicator explicitly
4. **Discuss real examples** — When have they felt these pressures?
5. **Build recognition skills** — What internal signals warn them?

### Key Teaching Points

- **Trust is the attack surface.** The closer the relationship, the higher the risk.
- **Guilt is a manipulation tool.** "If you don't help, something bad happens" is a red flag, not a reason to act.
- **Urgency bypasses verification.** Any request that "can't wait" should trigger suspicion.
- **Empathy can be exploited.** Feeling sorry for someone is not a reason to skip protocols.
- **Continuity references build false legitimacy.** Attackers research relationships.

---

## 📈 Strategic Outcome

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Differentiated** | EIOC scenarios test what generic training ignores |
| **Realistic** | Mirrors actual sophisticated social engineering |
| **Actionable** | Builds emotional recognition, not just technical awareness |
| **Defensible** | Prepares for attacks that exploit trust, not just ignorance |

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Generic security awareness training has diminishing returns. People learn to spot obvious phishing emails—and attackers adapt.

Sophisticated social engineering doesn't rely on suspicious links or bad grammar. It relies on:
- Relationships that already exist
- History that's been researched
- Emotions that override judgment
- Guilt that prevents pushback

EIOC Guard trains people to recognize *emotional manipulation patterns*, not just technical indicators. That's the gap in the market. That's what makes this framework valuable.
