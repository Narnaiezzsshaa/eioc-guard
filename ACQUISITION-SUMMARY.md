# EIOC Guard™ — Executive Summary

**Acquisition & Partnership Opportunity**

---

## The Opportunity

EIOC Guard™ is a novel security awareness training methodology that addresses the **root cause** of social engineering success: emotional manipulation. Unlike existing solutions that focus on technical recognition (suspicious URLs, phishing indicators), EIOC Guard™ trains users to recognize the **psychological states** that attackers deliberately induce.

---

## Market Problem

| Statistic | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| 68% of breaches involve human error | Technical controls alone are insufficient |
| 442% increase in social engineering (H2 2024) | Threat is accelerating rapidly |
| SMB employees face 350% more attacks | Underserved market with acute need |
| Security awareness market: $5.6B by 2028 | Large addressable market |

**The Gap:** Current training teaches employees *what* to look for (technical indicators). EIOC Guard™ teaches employees *how they're being manipulated* (emotional indicators) — a fundamentally different and complementary approach.

## The EIOC Framework

A proprietary taxonomy mapping emotional vulnerability states to technical exploit patterns:

| EIOC Category | Attack Pattern | Real-World Example |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Prestige Mirage | Executive impersonation | Barbara Corcoran ($388K BEC attempt) |
| Familiarity Shortcut | Vendor impersonation | Cabarrus County ($1.7M loss) |
| Performance Reflex | Urgency exploitation | Centrify wire transfer attack |
| Empathic Camouflage | Help-desk manipulation | Snapchat W-2 breach |
| Deference Drift | Authority exploitation | Toyota Boshoku ($37M loss) |

**Stewardship Cues™** — Memorable defensive phrases that interrupt manipulation patterns in real-time.

## Competitive Differentiation

| Existing Players | EIOC Guard™ |
|------------------|-------------|
| KnowBe4, Proofpoint, Mimecast | Complementary, not competitive |
| Focus: Recognize phishing emails | Focus: Recognize emotional manipulation |
| Approach: Fear/compliance-based | Approach: Stewardship/empowerment |
| Metric: Click rates | Metric: Emotional resilience |
| Content: Generic scenarios | Content: Personalized vulnerability profiling |

**Positioning:** EIOC Guard™ can be offered as a standalone product OR integrated into existing platforms as a differentiated module.

## Strategic Fit: Herjavec Group

EIOC Guard™ aligns with Herjavec Group's portfolio and market position:

- **Managed Security Services:** EIOC training complements existing MSSP offerings
- **SMB Focus:** Addresses underserved market segment
- **Human Element:** Fills gap in human-centric security offerings
- **Differentiation:** Novel methodology competitors cannot easily replicate
- **Thought Leadership:** Framework provides content for marketing, speaking, publications

---

## Investment Required to Scale

| Phase | Investment | Outcome |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Pilot Program | $50-100K | Validate with 5-10 customers |
| MVP Platform | $200-400K | Admin dashboard, basic reporting |
| Enterprise Ready | $500K-1M | Full LMS integration, API, compliance reporting |

*Note: Estimates assume acquisition/partnership providing development resources. Standalone bootstrap would require significantly longer timeline.*

## Creator Background

- Certified Pharmacy Technician transitioning to cybersecurity
- CompTIA certified (A+ through CySA+), AWS certified
- Published author: 6 cybersecurity education books (Amazon KDP)
- Founder: SoftArmorLabs (cybersecurity consulting, SMB focus)
- Currently pursuing SANS certifications

**Unique Perspective:** Background in healthcare (patient care), philosophy, and contemplative practices informs the "stewardship" approach to security — treating protection as care rather than control.
