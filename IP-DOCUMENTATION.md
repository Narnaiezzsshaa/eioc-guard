- Created technical mappings connecting psychological states to attack patterns
- Researched and integrated real-world case studies (Barbara Corcoran, Cabarrus County, Toyota Boshoku, Snapchat, Centrify)

### Phase 3: Product Development (June 2025 - August 2025)

- Designed and developed interactive assessment tool
- Created scoring algorithms and vulnerability profiling system
- Built user interface with progress tracking and results visualization
- Developed personalized recommendation engine

### Phase 4: Public Disclosure (August 2025)

- Published interface preview on LinkedIn (personal professional account)
- Shared with professional network for initial feedback
- Established public timestamp of invention disclosure

### Phase 5: Continued Development (September 2025 - Present)
