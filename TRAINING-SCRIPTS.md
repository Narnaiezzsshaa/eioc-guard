## 📋 Facilitator Guidance (Universal)

### Before Each Session

1. Review the specific industry module
2. Prepare to read scenarios aloud with appropriate emotional tone
3. Have role-play pairings ready

### During Each Session

1. **Always present Generic first, then EIOC** — let the contrast land
2. **Pause after the EIOC version** — let learners feel the pull before discussing
3. **Break down emotional levers explicitly** — name each one
4. **Normalize vulnerability** — "Attackers exploit good traits: empathy, duty, trust"
5. **Teach counter-moves** — verify through official channels, slow down, escalate

### Key Phrases to Use

- *"It's not about being naïve—it's about being human."*
- *"The more emotional levers active at once, the harder to resist."*
- *"Guilt is a manipulation tool, not a reason to act."*
- *"Urgency is a red flag, not a reason to rush."*

### Counter-Moves to Teach

| Pressure | Counter-Move |
|----------|--------------|
| Urgency | "Let me verify through official channels first." |
| Guilt | "I want to help, but I need to follow protocol." |
| Authority | "I'll confirm this request directly with [person]." |
| Empathy | "I understand you're stressed. Let me check this properly so we both stay safe." |
