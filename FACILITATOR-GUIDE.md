# EIOC Guard™ Facilitator Guide

## Presenting Generic vs. EIOC-Enhanced Scenarios

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Help learners understand that **Emotional Indicators of Compromise (EIOC)** are about spotting when attackers exploit psychological vulnerabilities—not just technical mistakes.

This guide equips facilitators to present scenarios in a way that makes the emotional manipulation **clear and memorable**.

---

## 🧭 Session Flow

### 1. Introduce the Concept (5 minutes)

**Say something like:**

> "Traditional security training focuses on obvious red flags—bad grammar, suspicious links, unknown senders. And that's useful. But modern attackers have adapted. They don't rely on you being careless. They rely on you being *human*."

**Key points to establish:**

- Compliance training catches obvious attacks
- Sophisticated attacks exploit **emotional levers**: trust, empathy, duty, guilt, urgency, authority, continuity
- EIOC trains people to recognize manipulation, not just phishing

---

### 2. Show Side-by-Side Scenarios (10 minutes)

**Step 1:** Present the **Generic version** first.

> *"Here's a typical phishing scenario you might see in compliance training."*

Read the generic scenario aloud. Ask:
- "What are the red flags here?"
- "Would you fall for this?"

Most participants will confidently say no.

**Step 2:** Present the **EIOC-Enhanced version**.

> *"Now here's the same attack—but designed by someone who did their homework."*

Read the EIOC scenario aloud **with emotional tone**—stress, urgency, pleading. Let it land.

**Step 3:** Ask the key question:

> *"Which one would be harder to resist in real life?"*

Let silence sit. The answer is obvious, and the discomfort is the point.

### 3. Highlight Emotional Indicators (10 minutes)

Break down the EIOC scenario into its emotional levers:

| Indicator | How It Appears in the Scenario |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Trust** | Message comes from someone known—colleague, manager, client |
| **Continuity** | References shared history—"the patient we discussed," "last week's invoice" |
| **Empathy** | Sender appears stressed, overwhelmed, vulnerable |
| **Duty** | Appeals to professional responsibility—"the patient needs," "the team depends on" |
| **Urgency** | Time pressure—"before my shift ends," "before auditors arrive" |
| **Guilt** | Consequence framing—"if you don't help, something bad happens" |
| **Authority** | Comes from someone senior or respected |

**Teaching point:**

> *"Notice how many levers are active at once. That's not an accident. Sophisticated attackers layer these deliberately. The more layers, the harder to resist."*

---

### 4. Facilitated Discussion (10 minutes)

**Ask learners:**

- *"How would you feel if you received the EIOC version?"*
- *"What would make you hesitate to verify?"*
- *"Have you ever acted quickly because you didn't want to let someone down?"*

**Guide them to recognize:**

- Emotions can override rational verification steps
- The pressure to help is real—and exploitable
- Guilt is a manipulation tool, not a reason to act

**Normalize vulnerability:**

> *"It's not about being naïve. It's about being human. Attackers exploit empathy and duty precisely because they're good traits. The goal isn't to stop caring—it's to recognize when caring is being weaponized."*

---

### 5. Practice & Reflection (15 minutes)

**Role-play exercise:**

- Pair participants
- One reads the EIOC scenario aloud (with emotional tone)
- The other practices responding: verifying, slowing down, escalating
- Switch roles

**Reflection prompts:**

- *"What emotional lever did you feel most strongly?"*
- *"What internal signal warned you something was off?"*
- *"How would you counter that pressure in the moment?"*

**Teach counter-moves:**

| Pressure | Counter-Move |
|----------|--------------|
| Urgency | "Let me verify through official channels first." |
| Guilt | "I want to help, but I need to follow protocol." |
| Authority | "I'll confirm this request directly with [person]." |
| Empathy | "I understand you're stressed. Let me check this properly so we both stay safe." |

## 🎭 Facilitator Tips

### Dramatize the Tone

Read the EIOC emails aloud with appropriate emotion:
- Stress in the voice
- Urgency in the pacing
- Pleading in the inflection

The scenarios are designed to *feel* real. Your delivery makes that happen.

### Pause for Impact

After presenting the EIOC version, **let silence sit** before asking for reactions.

Discomfort is part of the learning. Don't rush past it.

### Normalize Vulnerability

Remind learners:

> *"If you felt uncomfortable or uncertain, that's the point. These scenarios are designed to exploit good instincts—trust, empathy, helpfulness. The goal is to recognize the manipulation, not to stop being a good person."*

### Anchor with Strategy

Always end with actionable counter-moves:

- **Verify through official channels** (not the contact info in the email)
- **Slow down** (urgency is a red flag, not a reason to rush)
- **Escalate** (when in doubt, ask someone else)
- **Name the pressure** ("I notice I'm feeling guilty—that's a signal to pause")

## 📊 Measuring Success

### Immediate Indicators

- Participants can name the emotional levers in a scenario
- Participants articulate why EIOC scenarios are harder to resist
- Participants demonstrate counter-moves in role-play

### Behavioral Indicators (Post-Training)

- Increased verification requests before acting on urgent asks
- More escalations when "something feels off"
- Reported near-misses where emotional manipulation was recognized

### Organizational Indicators

- Reduced successful social engineering attacks
- Improved response to simulated EIOC-style phishing tests
- Culture shift from "don't click bad links" to "recognize manipulation"

## 🔑 Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **Trust is the attack surface.** The closer the relationship, the higher the risk.

2. **Guilt is a manipulation tool.** "If you don't help, something bad happens" is a red flag, not a reason to act.

3. **Urgency bypasses verification.** Any request that "can't wait" should trigger suspicion, not compliance.

4. **Empathy can be weaponized.** Feeling sorry for someone is not a reason to skip protocols.

5. **It's not about being naïve—it's about being human.** Attackers exploit good traits. Recognition is the defense.
