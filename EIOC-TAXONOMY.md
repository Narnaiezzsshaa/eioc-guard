# EIOC™ Taxonomy

**One Acronym. Twenty-Two Frameworks. One Year of Development.**

EIOC began as *Emotional Indicators of Compromise*—a framework for detecting social engineering through emotional triggers. It has since evolved into a comprehensive taxonomy spanning cybersecurity, human behavior, education, creative practice, and systems thinking.

Same four letters. Different masks for different contexts.

- **Accessibility** — Adapting language and format to the audience
- **Timestamp integrity** — Documenting development for IP protection
