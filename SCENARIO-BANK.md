# EIOC Guard™ Scenario Bank

## Rotating Emotionally-Layered Variants by Role

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This scenario bank provides **3–4 emotionally layered variants per role** to prevent assessment gaming. Facilitators rotate scenarios so learners must recognize manipulation patterns—not memorize scripts.

**Long-term goal:** Expand to 8–10 variants per role for deeper resilience training.

---

## 🧩 How to Use This Bank

1. **Rotate scenarios** — Never use the same variant twice with the same group
2. **Ask recognition questions** — "Which emotional levers are being exploited here?"
3. **Role-play variants** — Keep training unpredictable
4. **Encourage reflection** — Learners journal emotions felt and counter-moves
