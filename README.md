## Overview

EIOC Guard™ is a proprietary security awareness training platform that addresses the root cause of social engineering success: **emotional manipulation**.

While traditional security training focuses on recognizing technical indicators (malicious URLs, suspicious attachments), EIOC Guard™ trains employees to recognize the **emotional states** that attackers deliberately induce to bypass rational decision-making.

### The Problem

- 68% of cyber attacks involve human error (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- Social engineering increased 442% in H2 2024
- SMB employees face 350% more social engineering attempts than enterprise employees
- Traditional awareness training has diminishing returns — employees "tune out"

### The EIOC Solution

Just as technical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) signal system intrusion, **Emotional Indicators of Compromise (EIOCs)** signal psychological manipulation in progress.

EIOC Guard™ provides:

1. **A Novel Classification System** — Five distinct emotional vulnerability categories with technical mappings
2. **Stewardship Cues™** — Memorable defensive phrases that interrupt manipulation patterns
3. **Self-Assessment Tools** — Personalized vulnerability profiling without shame-based metrics
4. **Case-Study Integration** — Real-world breach examples tied to specific emotional exploits

## The EIOC Framework

| EIOC Category | Technical Mapping | Stewardship Cue™ |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 🎭 Prestige Mirage | Status-Based Exploit | "Signal is earned, not borrowed." |
| 🤝 Familiarity Shortcut | Implicit Trust Injection | "Pause before you mirror." |
| ⚡ Performance Reflex | Urgency Trigger Exploit | "Urgency is not a credential." |
| 💝 Empathic Camouflage | Affinity Bias Pretexting | "Familiar warmth may conceal cold intent." |
| 👔 Deference Drift | Authority Spoof Lever | "Stewardship honors questions." |

## Differentiation

| Traditional Training | EIOC Guard™ |
|---------------------|-------------|
| "Don't click suspicious links" | "Recognize when you're being emotionally manipulated" |
| Fear-based compliance | Stewardship-based empowerment |
| Generic scenarios | Role-specific vulnerability profiling |
| Pass/fail testing | Growth-oriented readiness assessment |
| Annual checkbox | Continuous emotional literacy development |
