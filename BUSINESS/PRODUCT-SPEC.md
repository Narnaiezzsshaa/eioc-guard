### Template Engine

**Core Template Structure:**
```
[SENDER_RELATIONSHIP] + [CONTINUITY_REFERENCE] + [EMOTIONAL_TONE] + [ACTION_REQUEST] + [CONSEQUENCE]
```

**Variable Placeholders:**

| Placeholder | Options |
|-------------|---------|
| `[SENDER]` | Colleague, Supervisor, Client, Vendor, Family member, Senior executive, Peer, Mentee |
| `[RELATIONSHIP_HISTORY]` | "we worked on together," "you helped me with last week," "we've known each other for years," "remember when you..." |
| `[EMOTIONAL_TONE]` | Stressed, Pleading, Apologetic, Anxious, Urgent, Overwhelmed, Grateful-in-advance |
| `[ACTION_REQUEST]` | Open attachment, Click link, Approve transfer, Update records, Apply patch, Process request, Share information |
| `[CONSEQUENCE]` | "or the team suffers," "or I'll let everyone down," "or we lose the client," "or production halts," "before the deadline" |
| `[TIME_PRESSURE]` | "in the next hour," "before end of day," "before my shift ends," "before the meeting," "immediately" |

**Example Template:**
```
Email from [SENDER] you've [RELATIONSHIP_HISTORY].
Tone: [EMOTIONAL_TONE]

"[GREETING], [CONTINUITY_REFERENCE]. I'm [EMOTIONAL_STATE] and 
[ACTION_REQUEST] [TIME_PRESSURE]. [CONSEQUENCE]. [GUILT_HOOK]."
```

**Generated Output Example:**
```
Email from a colleague you've worked with for three years.
Tone: Stressed, apologetic

"Hey, remember the patient case we discussed last Tuesday? I'm 
completely overwhelmed with the audit prep and I need you to 
review this file before my shift ends in 20 minutes. If it 
doesn't get reviewed, the compliance team will flag our whole 
unit. I'm really counting on you here—I wouldn't ask if it 
wasn't urgent."
```

---

### Output Components

**For each generated scenario, the engine produces:**

**1. Scenario Text**
```
The full scenario narrative (email, SMS, conversation)
formatted for presentation to learners.
```

**2. Facilitator Notes**
```
EMOTIONAL LEVERS EXPLOITED:
- Trust: Known colleague, established relationship
- Continuity: References shared patient case
- Empathy: Sender is overwhelmed
- Urgency: 20-minute deadline
- Guilt: "counting on you," unit consequences

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: 3 (Triple lever)

REALISTIC DETAILS:
- Specific time reference (last Tuesday)
- Concrete deadline (20 minutes)
- Organizational consequence (compliance flag)
```

**3. Role-Play Script**
```
ATTACKER LINES:
- Opening: [stressed tone] "Hey, do you have a second?"
- Pressure: "I really wouldn't ask if it wasn't urgent."
- Escalation: "The whole unit is counting on this."
- Guilt close: "I don't know what I'll do if this doesn't get done."

FACILITATOR COACHING:
- Emphasize the stressed vocal tone
- Use pauses to create pressure
- Make eye contact during guilt statements
```

**4. Assessment Prompt**
```
RECOGNITION QUESTION:
"Which emotional levers are being exploited in this scenario?"

DECISION QUESTION:
"What would you do, and why?"

COUNTER-MOVE QUESTION:
"How would you respond while maintaining the relationship?"
```
