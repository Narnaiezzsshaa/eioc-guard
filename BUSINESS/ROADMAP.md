## Emotional Vector Mapping

Each scenario maps to underlying EIOC emotional indicators:

| Emotional Vector | Attack Exploitation | Example Trigger |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Urgency** | Bypasses verification steps | "Critical," "Immediate action required" |
| **Authority** | Overrides personal judgment | "CEO request," "Regulatory mandate" |
| **Fear** | Triggers compliance without thought | "Account suspended," "Legal action pending" |
| **Trust** | Exploits established relationships | "Your vendor," "IT department" |
| **Duty** | Leverages professional responsibility | "Patient needs," "Student safety" |
| **Curiosity** | Baits engagement | "Shift schedule," "Salary info" |
| **Helpfulness** | Exploits desire to assist | "Can you help me access..." |
| **Fatigue** | Targets end-of-shift vulnerability | Late-night requests, weekend emergencies |

---

## How to Use This Matrix

1. **Add new industries** → Identify sectors with distinct operational environments
2. **List critical roles** → Map out who is most exposed in daily operations
3. **Identify top vulnerabilities** → 3–5 attack vectors per role
4. **Design scenarios** → Realistic, role-specific situations tied to emotional vectors
5. **Write questionnaire prompts** → Short, decision-forcing questions that test awareness
6. **Implement feedback loop** → Use results to refine and prioritize scenarios

---

## Why This Works

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scalable** | Each new industry × role combination expands the library organically |
| **Customizable** | Assessments can be tailored per department, role, or client |
| **Actionable** | Results highlight which roles need targeted training |
| **Realistic** | Role-specific scenarios increase engagement and reduce checkbox fatigue |
| **Measurable** | Track vulnerabilities by role and industry, not just generic categories |

---

## Strategic Outcome

- **Multiply scenario library organically**: Each role × industry combination yields new questionnaires
- **Create a living assessment framework**: Grows with industry shifts (e.g., telehealth, AI-driven fraud, remote work)
- **Position EIOC Guard as role-aware defense**: Not just a compliance tool, but an adaptive system that maps to organizational reality

---

## Integration Positioning

EIOC Guard™ can be offered as:

- **Standalone product** → Direct deployment for organizations
- **Integrated module** → Bolt-on to existing security awareness platforms (KnowBe4, Proofpoint, Mimecast)
- **API service** → Emotional vulnerability scoring for third-party applications
- **White-label solution** → Branded implementations for MSSPs and consultancies
